        <p>What is a planet? Well, its official definition is "a very large round object in space that moves around the sun or another star". A more modern definition is "any of the large bodies that revolve around the Sun in the solar system." Here is a list of the planets in our own solar system with their description if you want to learn more about it!</p>

            <img src="../assets/Mercury.jpeg" alt="Mercury">
            <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the solar system. It has no atmosphere and experiences extreme temperature variations, from blistering heat during the day to freezing cold at night. This stark environment makes it one of the most fascinating planets to study.</p>
